# Dreivy_engine
This is engine written only by me,just 4 fun.
It will only work on Windows and requires DX11 support(in future i will add DX9 support)

It is written with only pure WinApi and DirectX 11. So just open VS 2026 project and click F5 to run it!

You can find documentation on some modules(f.e. WindowManager in ***Source/WindowManager/*** )
